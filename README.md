# InsideOut-OS
This is the repository for storing the source code of my personal hobby project InsideOut-OS (or one could call it the real Rimont OS).

For whatever reason, the source code isn't stored correctly and git wasn't really used in the development of this OS.
Therefore, instead of doing the morally correct thing (being removing these stupid submodules and uploading the code correctly),
I will slap in a tar.xz archive in the root.

*Feel free to fork this!! Please do!!!!*

## Issues
- Kernel won't get past the ACPI initialization.
- The call stack does get a bit quirky at night.
- Kernel refuses to work with more than 3.5GB of RAM. I tried fixing this one, but I'm not sure it worked!

If you somehow manage to fix these, may whoever is up there bless your soul.
